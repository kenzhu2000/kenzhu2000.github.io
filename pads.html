<h2>Processing of Ad Hoc Data</h2>
Please refer to the description of ad hoc data at the 
<a href="http://www.padsproj.org">PADS website</a>.
<br>

Current Projects:<br>

<ul>
<li> Efficient PADS parser - The existing parser is not efficient and 
has incorrect Union semantics. We are building a next generation PADS parser in Haskell.

<li> Test data generator - Real world test data are not always available. We are building a universal data generator by designing a high level declarative 
language that can automatically generate test data in ad hoc data format which
conforms to a variety of constraints, dependencies, and data distributions. 
</ul>
