\subsection*{Assignment Policy Acknowledgement:}
\textit{There will be several homework assignments in this course. Most of the tasks will require
handwritten or typed solutions. Some assignments may have programming tasks. The solution to
programming tasks can be programmed in base versions of specific programming language which will be specify in homeworks. 
\textbf{All homework submissions must be submitted via Canvas. No other method of
submission accepted under any circumstances.} All homework scores (other than the lowest
one) will contribute to your final grade. If you find yourself in an emergency and cannot deliver
homework on time, immediately inform the instructor. Also, while working with other persons on
non-graded example problems from the textbook is a good way to help you develop your
understanding and insight into the techniques of problem solving, homework solutions must be
your work only. Violations of this will not be tolerated and result in severe penalties for all parties
involved, in strict compliance to official UTA policy.}\\
\newline
\textit{The points each assignment graded out of will be provided as part of its description. Assignments
submitted late will be automatically penalized, at a rate of \textbf{30\% of assignment max points per
day late. Late submission will not be accepted 2 days after due date.} Note that for some
assignments, submissions may not be accepted after the deadline (such assignments will
be announced in class beforehand). The submission due time (and the time the link will be
available till) will be shown in homeworks and Canvas. Exceptions will only be made for documented emergencies,
in strict adherence to UTA policy. Computer/Network crashes, Submission of Incomplete files,
Submission of Incorrect Files, Submitting at Incorrect Link are NOT acceptable excuses for late
submissions. \textbf{No exceptions will be made.} To avoid problems with such crashes and last-minute
problems, students are encouraged to submit as early as possible. They are also advised to
ensure that their file was uploaded correctly before submitting it. You can always revise your
submission till the deadline. If you are unable to work on/submit an assignment due to a valid
documented reason (illness, critical family emergencies, military service obligations, observance
of major religious holidays, and certain university service commitments) one makeup assignment
may be provided that will be due during finals week.}\\

\section*{Problem 3 - 40\%}
Visit \href{https://huggingface.co/models}{HuggingFace models} and create a table describing each of the twelve NLP task categories and each of the six audio task categories listed on the page's sidebar.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Model Selection and Testing}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Choose a top-performing model for three of the eighteen tasks.
        \item Write code to provide test example for each selected model to verify that it works for the respective task.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Comparison with LLM}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For at least one of the selected tasks, find an input where an LLM (eg, ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama, Claude, etc.) either outperforms or underperforms compared to the model.
        \item Provide a justification for the observed difference in performance. If no justification is obvious then just mention that.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
Your solution to this problem must be in a notebook (\<YourName\>.ipynb) with shown outputs that when run on Google Colab shows the same outputs. Add a screenshot of the LLM output in the notebook and mention there your justification as well.
